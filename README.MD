## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the password validation interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic behind password validation and dynamic feedback.

## Features

1. **Password Validation**:
   - The app checks if the password meets the following criteria:
     - At least 9 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character

2. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - A strength indicator bar updates as the user types, showing how many requirements are met.
   - Password requirements are listed below the input field, turning green with a checkmark when fulfilled.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Instant visual feedback provides a clear understanding of password strength during entry.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmilioGall/kata-strong-password-validator.git
   cd kata-strong-password-validator
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Set up the project structure with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   
2. **Password Validation Logic**:
   - Implement JavaScript functions to validate each password criterion (length, uppercase, number, special character).
   
3. **Dynamic Feedback UI**:
   - Build a visual indicator (progress bar) that updates as the user types, showing real-time password strength.

4. **Completion of UI Requirements**:
   - Implement the color-changing checklist that provides visual feedback as each password requirement is met.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test various password inputs to ensure that all validation rules are correctly enforced and that the feedback works as intended.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the app on a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages) for easy access.
